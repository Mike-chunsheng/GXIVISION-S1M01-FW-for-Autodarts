Dear Autodarts players

In order to improve the user experience, we have pre-burned the camera firmware that is most suitable for Autodarts scenarios in the cameras we sell. You can use it directly after receiving the camera without burning the firmware again. And we will temporarily close the multiple versions of camera firmware released before.

The reason is that we have debugged various camera firmwares for the use environment of Autodarts before, and shared them here to adapt to different scenarios. The original intention is to facilitate more players to choose independently.
However, some Autodarts players have reported to us that it is difficult for them to have multiple firmwares and burn them, and there may even be a risk that the camera cannot work properly due to incorrect operation, causing a lot of trouble. This is not what we want to see. They hope to use the camera directly after getting it and quickly get into the game, so we made the above decision.

Thank you for your support. If you need help in use, you can write to us ï¼š hechunsheng@gxivision.com.

Our engineers will try their best to cooperate and meet your needs.
