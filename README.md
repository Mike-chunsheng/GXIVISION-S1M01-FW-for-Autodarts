Dear Autodarts players:

We have previously debugged various camera firmware for the Autodarts usage environment, with the aim of adapting to different scenarios for more customers and facilitating their own selection. However, after communicating with some Autodarts players, we received feedback that having so many firmware options may be meaningless because Autodarts players are more focused on the game itself rather than trying various effects of the camera. We only need to provide the best firmware to players, and more firmware options also bring more risks. Some Autodarts players' misoperation during the flashing process may even cause the camera to not work properly, causing a lot of trouble, which we do not want to see.

Therefore, in order to eliminate this risk, we will temporarily disable this update. We have pre burned the camera firmware that is most suitable for Autodarts scenes in the products we sell. Autodarts can use it directly after receiving it without any further action.

If you still have some special needs regarding this, you can write to us: hechunsheng@gxivision.com 

Our engineers will try their best to cooperate and meet your needs.
